# dotfiles

Feel free to use anything you find here, just as I have done with the dotfiles of others.

I use stow to manage my dotfiles with git. By running the install.sh script you can choose what folders to install. All folders except for the "system" folder will create symlinks in your home directory to the files located here. Note the folder structure under each directory.
